                Hello visitor! My name is Brandon Moya and I am currently a student at Cal Poly Pomona. I am a fourth year Computer Science major! My hometown is Rosemead, CA. Some of my hobbies include playing and creating video games, watching movies, and exploring new places to eat! Anyways, I should probably fill this section out with some more content just so that the page looks more filled and looks kinda cool, I dont know. Does this look cool that it's kinda long? Probably not, but whatever. Either way it'll make the page look hefty. How is your day professor? I dont know if you'll read this but yea, hope you're doing great. Oh right there are some sample questions in the assignment specifications. One of my favorite movies is definitely La La Land. I really enjoy musicals but I found myself completely obsessed with this movie for months.
